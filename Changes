* GCrypt.xs: Rename blksize attribute to blklen throughout for conformity.
(GCrypt_Cipher): Add keylen attribute.
(gcry_cipher_new): Initialise it here.
(gcry_cipher_setkey): Use it to pad or truncate key as needed.
(gcry_cipher_sync, gcry_cipher_keylen, gcry_cipher_blklen,
gcry_cipher_DESTROY): New functions.
* t/1.t: Test the keylen and blklen methods on the various ciphers.
Replace one aes application with twofish to get more cipher variety.
* GCrypt.pm: Describe sync, keylen and blklen.
Try to explain the modes a bit.

	- originally created by h2xs 1.22 with options
		-O -b 5.6.0 -n GCrypt /usr/include/gcrypt.h
	- I later zilched all constant handling, so "-c" would have been better
	  from the start.
